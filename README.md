# Exercise-AutoLayout-0

In this exercise you will learn to work with AutoLayout.

## Tips
1. The device in the iOS simulator can be rotated by using the shortcuts `⌘+←` and `⌘+→`.

## Tasks
For all tasks you are free to pick any UI element: UIView, UILabel, UIImageView, etc. Rotate the device for every task to test wheter your implementation is correct.

1. Use only *Align*! Add 1 element to the view controller. Align this element in the center. What happens when you rotate the device?
2. Use only *Pin*! Add 2 elements to the view controller. Align 1 element at the top left and 1 element at the bottom right. What happens when you rotate the device?
3. Add 4 elements to the view controller. Allign 1 element at the top, 1 left, 1 right and 1 at the bottom. Ensure every element stays aligned correctly when rotating. What happens when you rotate the device?
4. Add 5 elements to the view controller. Allign the 1st element in the center, align the other 4 elements (relative) arround the 1st. What happens when you rotate the device?
5. Change the values of some constraints from code.
6. Change the values of some constraints from code, with animation.
